## Features
The project starts with the system getting a word from the wordlist that is to be used for the round. The system then asks the user for a letter guess as an input for the game. If the letter is the word, the system returns the world list replaced with the guessed letter and the system continues. If the letter is not in the word, the system prompts the user about the error and generates the diagram of the hangman as a progress visual for the game. The game ends once the word is guessed under 6 tries or the player runs out of tries. 

Some key features.
* Uses a dictionary from another file as the database of the game.
* Interactive scoring and UI visuals
